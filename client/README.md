# Sticky Note
This is a Note Taking app built with [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) with the help of the [VueCLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

I've also used the [HTML5 Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for a fake database just for demo purposes.
